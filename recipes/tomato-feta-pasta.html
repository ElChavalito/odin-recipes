    <h2>What We're Cooking</h2>
    <p>This feta tomato pasta dish is super easy to make in just 20 minutes — dinner doesn't get much quicker or tastier than this! Boil any short pasta shape, and make the cheesy tomato sauce while the pasta boils. That's about it!</p>
    
    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prep Time</b>: 5 mins</li>
            <li><b>Cook Time</b>: 15 mins</li>
            <li><b>Total Time</b>: 20 minss</li>
            <li><b>Servings</b>: 4</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>16 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and salt to taste. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are soft and have released their juices, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and immediately add to the pan of tomatoes. Reduce heat to low and toss to coat. Add feta cheese, and basil and stir through. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>For best results</em>, use real Greek feta cheese made from sheep's and goat's milk. Feta-like cheeses made from cow's milk will not melt in the same way, resulting in a grainy texture.</li>  
            <li>Change up the flavor by adding sliced garlic and/or red chili flakes. Instead of basil you can use mint or parsley.</li>
            <li>You can use any pasta shape in place of the penne. Farfalle or fusilli both work well, but spaghetti is great, too.</li>
        </ul>
